# Best Pacman Ever
### Humaira Ahmed

The game adopts an easy to use user-interface, which uses the pacman colours - red, yellow and black. 

**HOW TO PLAY:**
1. Enter username on the start screen
2. Set up your game board by choosing a background, wall and cookie colour. If you don't want to personalise the board, the standard game colours will be used (white, blue and brown)
3. Choose a level
    - Easy: easy game board with _three_ ghosts
    - Intermediate: standard game board with _four_ ghosts
    - Hard: hard gameboard with _five_ ghosts 
4. Press START under the chosen level to play
5. Move the Pacman using the arrow keys (`up`, `down`, `left`, `right`)
6. Try and score as many points as possible, without being caught by a ghost :ghost:
    - You have 3 lives, touching a ghost makes you lose a life. A life counter is kept at the bottom of the game board 
    - Cookies :black_circle: : worth 5 points
    - Cherries :cherries: :  worth 20 points 
7. When the game is over, a score board pops up showing you your score for each round, highest at the top and the total points scored
8. By pressing the 'view highscore' button, another board will pop up showing the top 10 high scores of all time 
9. Press the `esc` key on the keyboard to restart the game

Java 8 has been used to produce this program in the IDE, IntelliJ.
